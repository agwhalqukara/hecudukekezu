Burnett will throw the ceremonial pitch, Martin, who hasn’t swung anything heavier than a golf club since he retired four years ago, quickly sent a plea to his old battery mate.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“The first thing Russ texted me was, ‘Please, do not throw me a curveball,’” Burnett said with a laugh.</p><p>Martin and Burnett each spent only small portions of their long big-league careers with the Pirates. Martin was their catcher in 2013 and 2014. Burnett was part of the starting rotation in 2012, 2013 and 2015.</p><p>Burnett and Martin will return to PNC Park on April 7 to handle first-pitch duties before the game against the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>White Sox</a>. This season marks the 10th anniversary of the Pirates team that snapped a 20-year string of losing records and beat the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Reds</a> in an electric National League wild-card game.</p><p>“It’s going to be nice to be there on the mound, look down and see Russ back there, man,” Burnett said. “I’m super pumped and I know the city’s going to be pumped. I’m sure of that.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/11/17160659/AJ-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1792 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>A.J. Burnett waves to the crowd after the final start of his career. (Justin Berl / Corbis / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)</span><p>It’s no coincidence the Pirates’ fortunes turned after Burnett and Martin arrived.</p><p>Former general manager Neal Huntington swapped a pair of minor leaguers to the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Yankees</a> for Burnett, who had a no-hitter and a World Series appearance on his resume. Over his first two seasons with the Pirates, Burnett won 26 games and posted a 3.41 ERA.</p><p>Burnett’s big-game credentials were a boon, but his gritty, no-prisoners approach was more important because it gave the pitching staff a much-needed edge.</p><p>“When I got there … they were a little bit unsure of themselves,” Burnett said. “To see what they became in ’13 — how they became men and just each grew into themselves — it was fun to watch.”</p><p>Martin was one of Huntington’s most astute free-agent signings. A good hitter and superb receiver, Martin helped steer the clubhouse.</p><p>“I remember the journey,” Martin said. “At the beginning, Pittsburgh wasn’t really a contender. They had that talent, but it was, when is the talent gonna flourish? Being part of that culture change and that transition was amazing.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Martin was part of <a href=#>an iconic moment</a> in the 2013 wild-card game. With a sellout “blackout” crowd howling at PNC Park, Reds pitcher <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Johnny Cueto</a> nervously fumbled the ball on the mound. Martin launched Cueto’s next pitch into the left-field bleachers to ignite a 6-2 victory.</p><p>“I’ll always remember that,” Martin said. “People are going crazy. I feel like I’m floating around the bases. It’s one of those moments where you kind of pinch yourselves afterward, like, ‘Did this really happen?’”</p><p>That home run was the high-water mark of the Pirates’ brief resurgence. After the 2014 season, Martin signed an $82 million free-agent deal with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Blue Jays</a>. Burnett spent 2014 with the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Phillies</a>, then rejoined the Pirates in 2015 and retired after the season.</p><p>“My first thought is we should have went further (in the playoffs),” Burnett said. “Like Russ said, we did great things. Those kids did great things. That’s what I’m most proud of.”</p><p>When chairman Bob Nutting recently called to ask about the first pitch, Burnett was hoping for a different sort of invitation. Burnett has let the Pirates know he’d love to help out in spring training in some capacity.</p><p>“I was hoping Bob wanted me to come down (to Bradenton) and say hi for a day or two,” Burnett, 46, said. “But he offered to get me (to Pittsburgh) for (the home opener). I’m glad he reached out, because I’ve been itching to get back to that city.”</p><p>Burnett’s signature pitch was a hard, biting curveball. He wasn’t afraid to bounce it to get a chase — a great way to get outs, but murder for the catcher who had to dig it out of the dirt, especially with runners on base.</p><p>“It’s gonna be fun (to catch Burnett) again, unless he throws me a curveball,” Martin said. “It’s probably gonna be in the dirt, I’m gonna have to block it and I’m not ready for that.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Burnett didn’t exactly promise to fire a perfect strike, but he hinted he’ll take it easy on Martin’s 40-year-old knees.</p><p>“I ain’t picked up a ball in five years,” Burnett said, “but I promise you that ball is going to get to home plate.”</p><p>(Top photo of Russell Martin and A.J.
