However, she ignored all of them until the brand was famous Gucci.</p><p>She was fascinated by its equestrian history of progress by <strong>Guccio Gucci,</strong> who was then a saddle maker. Even more, the creative director of Gucci, <strong>Frida,</strong> attracted her the most. Her work ethics, attention to the impeccable designer, desire to use the best material, touch of femininity, and a twist made Charlotte enthusiastic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/charlotte-casiraghi-88.jpg><p>Next thing we know, she was gracing the cover of fashion magazines such as W, Vogue, Elle, Vanity Fair, Oh La!, L magazine, Vanidades, Town & Country, Marie Claire, Hello!, to name some.

The couple welcomed their first child in 2013 and named him <strong>Raphael</strong>. As a matter of fact, they did not tie a knot with each other. In 2015 they separated from each other.</p><p>It was later that Charlotte and<strong> Dimitri Rassam</strong> dropped down the anchor. This dandy man is a film producer and a member of the Monegasque princely family. The auspicious occasion was held in Abbaye Sainte Marie de Pierredon in France.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/modelfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/charlotte-casiraghi-87.jpg><p>Casiraghi was looking stunning in her lace gown, designed by <strong>Giambattista Valli</strong>. The dress had an off the shoulder ruffled neckline and a boasted sheer sleeves, which were paired with a wispy veil. Not to mention her gown resembled a lot to her mother, Princess caroline’s wedding apparel.</p><p>Later on June 1, a ceremony was held at Prince’s Palace in Monaco. During that time, she was embellished in a Saint Laurent dress, which had a little crystal decked bow. Surprisingly the dress was a tribute to Grace Kelly’s wedding dress.</p><h2>Guys Charlotte Has Been With</h2><p>In 2004, this pretty model was dating <strong>Felix Winckler</strong> when they were at a university in Paris. The duo was spotted numerous times until they broke up in 2007. The same year, she was linked up with <strong>Gaspard Ulliel</strong>. Their relationship did not last as they had anticipated, and they broke up.</p><p>In 2007, this hottie dated London art gallery owner <strong>Alexander Dellal</strong>. They shared the same interest in the horse, and Alex even supported her in horse riding events. Luckily he was a date in the reception of uncle Prince Albert’s wedding to <strong>Princess Charlene.</strong></p><p>Moreover, Casiraghi was dating handsome<strong> Lamberto Sanfelice,</strong> who is an Italian director. They bumped into each other at her younger brother Pierre’s wedding with <strong>Beatrice Borromeo.</strong> The news of them dating came to light when he joined the family on a skiing vacation to Zurs. However, they broke up.</p><h2>What Is The Net Worth of Charlotte Casiraghi?</h2><p>Despite being a model, Casiraghi is involved in journalism and several other welfare programs. From her work, she has earned plenty of money, and from her work, as an activist, she has given tones.</p><h4><a title="Laneya Grace Age, Height, Body, Career, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Instagram" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laneya Grace Age, Height, Body, Career, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Instagram>></a></h4><p>In 2020 sources suggest that Casiraghi sits on a net worth of<strong> $30 million.</strong> She owns two horses. Her major way of earning is modeling and journalism.

Unfortunately, there is no valid information about her income, cars, and mansions (or should we say palace).</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Unfortunately, Charlotte is not active on any social media platforms.
