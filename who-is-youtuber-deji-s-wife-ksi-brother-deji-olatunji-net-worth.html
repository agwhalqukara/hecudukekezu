On his YouTube channel, “Deji,” the content producer typically posts comedic and gaming videos to amuse his audience.</p><p>Once known as “ComedyShortsGamer” on the internet as his moniker, Deji is also a professional boxer who came to international fame thanks to his amazing blogs, gaming streams, and short funny clips.</p><p>Onto his acting debut; in the 2016 release “Laid In America,” an American comedy film, Deji played the lead role as an actor. As Freddie, he played one of the supporting parts. His brother, “KSI,” who played Duncan, continued to play the key part in the film.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-youtuber-dejis-wife-is-he-married></span>Who is YouTuber Deji’s Wife?

The 25-year-old multifaceted Youtuber has not been married yet. So he does not have a wife.</p><p>Besides, Deji, currently single, had a relationship with YouTuber Dunjahh, whom he had first met ten years earlier on Runescape and with whom he had maintained touch ever since. In December 2021, the couple separated.</p><p>Dunjahh, whose real name is Dounja Akoudad, is a Belgian Youtuber and streamer. She is famous for putting out pranks, challenges, and funny vlogs on her channel.</p><p>In March 2019, Dunjahh made her first appearance on Deji’s secondary channel, ” Deji 2nd”. However, she posted a video on YouTube at that time detailing her unpleasant interactions with her ex-boyfriends. A fan suggested in the comments that she was afraid to start a new relationship; Dounja personally enjoyed the statement. Deji and Dunjahh parted ways in December 2021.</p><p>Moreover, Deji retaliated by mocking Randolph in a video and criticizing his wife while calling him KSI’s “slave” and doing anything for him. In response, Randolph released the diss track “Manchild,” directed at Deji, and claimed in a video that it was only a joke.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=deji-olatunji-brother-ksi-and-net-worth-2022></span>Deji Olatunji Brother KSI And Net Worth 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Deji Olatunji has a close relationship with and supports the career of his older brother Olajide “JJ” Olatunji, also known as KSI.
